Cozystack includes a number of cluster services.
They are deployed through tenant settings, and not through the application catalog.

Each tenant can have its own copy of cluster service or use the parent tenant's services.
Read more about the services sharing mechanism in [Tenant System]({{% ref "docs/guides/tenants#sharing-cluster-services" %}})
